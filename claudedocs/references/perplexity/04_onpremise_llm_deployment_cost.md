## Conclusion

The economic analysis strongly favors **on-premise deployment with domain adaptation** for the Humetro project, projecting **45-50% TCO reduction** over 5 years compared to pure API approaches. The hybrid strategy recommended for Phase 1 leverages API strengths (knowledge graph construction, evaluation) while building toward sustainable on-premise operations, aligning with the project's research goals of demonstrating technological sovereignty and cost-efficiency in public sector AI deployments.

The literature overwhelmingly supports that:

1. **Domain adaptation is cost-effective** (90-95% TCO reduction)
2. **Infrastructure optimization yields significant savings** (30-40% operational cost reduction)
3. **Hybrid strategies balance flexibility and cost** (5-6x cost reduction with maintained performance)
4. **On-premise makes economic sense at scale** (>10K queries/day breakeven point)

These findings provide robust academic backing for the thesis hypothesis that on-premise Graph RAG systems can achieve cost parity or superiority compared to API-based approaches while maintaining competitive performance.
