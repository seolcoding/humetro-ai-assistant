## Core Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Context Relevancy

**Definition:** Measures the retrieval system's ability to identify relevant and focused context passages from the knowledge base.

**What It Evaluates:**

- Relevance of retrieved documents to the user's query
- Precision of document selection
- Signal-to-noise ratio in retrieval results

**Importance:** Ensures that the retrieval component is actually finding pertinent information rather than returning irrelevant or tangentially related documents.

### 2. Faithfulness

**Definition:** Assesses the Large Language Model's ability to exploit retrieved passages accurately and reliably.

**What It Evaluates:**

- Accuracy of information usage from retrieved context
- Absence of hallucinations
- Proper representation of source information
- Grounding of generated responses in retrieved content

**Importance:** Ensures the generation component uses the retrieved context appropriately rather than introducing hallucinations or misrepresentations.

### 3. Generation Quality

**Definition:** Evaluates the overall quality of the generated responses independent of the retrieval and faithfulness dimensions.

**What It Evaluates:**

- Coherence of generated text
- Fluency and readability
- Completeness of answers
- Appropriateness of response style

## Key Characteristics of RAGAS

### Reference-Free Evaluation

**Innovation:** Provides a suite of metrics that evaluate different dimensions **without relying on ground truth human annotations**.

**Benefits:**

- Significantly reduces evaluation overhead
- Enables rapid iteration during development
- Practical for large-scale assessment
- Eliminates need for expensive human labeling

### Modular Architecture

**Design Philosophy:** Recognizes that RAG systems are inherently complex, being composed of both a retrieval module and an LLM-based generation module.

**Advantage:** By decomposing evaluation across separate dimensions, RAGAS enables researchers and practitioners to:

- Identify specific bottlenecks in RAG architectures
- Understand which components contribute to overall system performance
- Debug and optimize individual components independently

---

## Additional RAGAS Metrics (Extended Framework)

### Context Precision

**Definition:** Measures the proportion of relevant information in the retrieved context.

**Formula Concept:** Ratio of relevant retrieved passages to total retrieved passages.

**Use Case:** Identifies if the retrieval system is returning too much irrelevant information alongside relevant content.

### Context Recall

**Definition:** Assesses whether all necessary information for answering the query has been retrieved.

**Formula Concept:** Ratio of retrieved relevant information to all available relevant information.

**Use Case:** Identifies if the retrieval system is missing important information that should have been retrieved.

### Answer Correctness

**Definition:** Holistic measure combining factual accuracy with semantic similarity to ideal answers.

**Components:**

- Factual overlap with ground truth (when available)
- Semantic similarity to expected answers
- Coverage of key information points

## Evaluation Workflow with RAGAS

### 1. System Setup

from ragas import evaluate
from ragas.metrics import (
    faithfulness,
    answer_relevancy,
    context_precision,
    context_recall,
    answer_correctness
)
```

### 2. Data Preparation

- **Questions:** User queries or test questions
- **Answers:** Generated responses from RAG system
- **Contexts:** Retrieved passages used for generation
- **Ground Truth:** (Optional) Reference answers for certain metrics

### 3. Metric Computation

- Metrics can be computed individually or as a suite
- Aggregate scores provide overall system assessment

### 4. Analysis and Optimization

- Targeted improvements based on metric-specific insights
- A/B testing of different RAG configurations
